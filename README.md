# Introduction

Hello! I am using this space as a multi-purpose area to learn more about windows, and programming in general. A lot of that learning falls under reading books like the Windows Internals Pt 1 \& 2, which is co-authored by Pavel Yosifovich, as well as his youtube videos.

My goal is that every time I watch or learn a new concept from Pavel, I want to immediately try to implement it to fit my use case or "example" case. In addition, I want to improve my programming and scripting capabilities, so I will also attempt to write the concept in multiple languages. 


## Goal

By following these guidelines, I am hoping to improve my general skillset with windows and programming, as well as being adaptable with multiple languages.



### Notes from the author
___
    * This repo is **NOT FOR YOU.** I want to share my general learning experience to hopefully help someone else, but at the same token, I personally do not care if you wouldn't have done it the same way as me, or that you wouldn't have used a certain language or style. Unless your Pavel himself or one of my trusted peers, your opinion will fall on deaf ears

    * I will link to all of my resources for the specific concept. I intend to cite my sources but I am forgetful and human. I will make corrections so that the right people receive credit.

    * Information used here will potentially be used to create content for the non-profit, Perkins Cybersecurity Education Fund

    * I am using AI to improve my learning experience. I don't intend to *vibe code* every concept, but I will use AI to help me understand better, and you may see snippets of generated code.
    
    * Don't take me seriously. If you're looking at this as a benchmark for me, my skillset, or the type of work that I do, then this will lead you astray
